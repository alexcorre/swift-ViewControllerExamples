swift-ViewControllerExamples
==========

Work in progress. More to come...

The purpose of this project was to learn swift and try to figure out some patterns to use for real life app development tasks.

So far we have:
* UITableView example
* A simple container view controller with a partially showing bottom view controller that can be dragged over the main view controller. The interaction was inspired by the Google Play app.

Instructions
------------

You will need the Xcode 6 Developer Preview to build and run the project. However, it should run under either iOS 7 or iOS 8 (on the simulator).
